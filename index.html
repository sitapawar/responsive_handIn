            <h1>Open Source Shakespeare Redesign</h1>
            <h2>Why OSS</h2>
            <p>I chose to redesign the Open Source Shakespeare (OSS) website because it has always been my favorite Shakespeare website and I’ve used it for both Shakespeare papers and productions. I love this site and care about increasing accessibility to books through digitizing them! I’m also passionate about the use of technology to analyze literature and the OSS database is an incredible resource for digital humanities. However, the interface itself is rather dated and unintuitive making it harder to use to its full potential. 
                <br><br>
                The most significant problems with the site that I identified were difficulty of navigation, lack of responsive design, lack of accessibility labels and alternative text. Additionally the site felt crowded with unnecessary text, was difficult to learn and remember, and spacing would glitch when navigating through the interface. 
                <br><br>
                The site has so many incredible features that are difficult to find and properly utilize due to the interface’s complexity. In my redesign I hoped to streamline the process of using the site while making it more aesthetic, accessible and adaptive to different device sizes. 
                <br><br>
                I used software like Lighthouse and WebAIM to test for accessibility and create a more informed redesign. There are many instances where alternative and label text is missing. Additionally, certain elements are not marked as headers, there aren’t page regions and a layout table is used. All of these things make it more difficult for screen readers to navigate the page.
